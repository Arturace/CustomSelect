# CustomSelect
A Web Component replicating the functionality of a default select, while giving you access to more customization.

Currently extremely basic and includes very little.


### The Yet-To-Do List
- Keyboard navigation (+ focusability)
- Better style management
- Some kind of testing
- A default and customizable search bar
  - A possible solution here, would be to provide an input as a label
- Better use of tempates:
  - Currently, the templates are outside the element (can be inside, but the element will be unaware of them until those are 'rendered'), which is limiting and disorganizing code.
